						<h4 class="pAbout">Despite having a fierce love for writing and literature, I found myself unhappy with the possible career paths,
						and ultimately setteled that writing and reading was more of a hobby.</h4>

						<h4 class="pAbout">I began searching for a career that allowed for some creative freedom but also encouraged collaberative work as I tend to work best on teams.
						After some time I found I most enjoyed crafting websites and constructing clever code to help give the face of my sites some life.
						</h4>

						<h4 class="pAbout">If you're looking to hire a new developer (or a team member to join your startup) please reach out! I'm excited to work with others and
						would love to collaberate and improve my personal skills while also bringing fresh ideas to the table.
